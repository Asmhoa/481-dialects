## Pros and Cons
1. **Idea 1 (Dialect Dataset)**
    - Pros
        - Prior work on constructing datasets from Twitter and about dialects
          exists (Blodgett et al. 2018 is a major example).
        - A couple sociolinguists at UW are familiar with collecting and
          standardizing data for dialects, and we could use them as a resource.
        - This is a space that hasn't seen much exploration, so we would provide
          the NLP community with a new type of data and set a precedent for
          future work.
    - Cons
        - Dialects are unstandardized by nature, and navigating the differences
          in transcription/orthography could be challenging.
        - Controlling for topic and other potential confounding factors could
          make creating a robust dataset difficult.
        - We would have to make several assumptions about what features define a
          dialect, and annotating for them will be time-consuming and difficult.
2. **Idea 2 (Supervised Classifier)**
3. **Idea 3 (Translation)**

## Codebases
- [tweepy](https://tweepy.org) is a Python package for obtaining tweets
- [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://mturk.com) is a crowdsourcing platform that
  we could use for annotations


## Lecture Topics
- Data Mining/Collection, especially methods for eliminating artifacts and
  ensuring robustness in annotations
